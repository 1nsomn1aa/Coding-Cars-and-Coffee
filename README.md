# The Three C's Club


The main goal of this website is to create a community where enthusiasts of coding and cars can come together to learn, connect, and share their passions in a relaxed and friendly environment. It informs the club members of upcoming events and helps them find other useful information, like contact or location details.

*Why Coffee?*

Well, one of the main ingredients in every car show or coding session is Coffee! Most car enthusiasts or coders cannot live without coffee. 

That's why the club is called The Three C's.

**Coding, Cars and Coffee!**

## Features

**Design**

The website was created with a focus on simplicity. The hero section was created in full viewport height and provides a lot of visual feedback from the fullscreen image of the car. That's why only two colors were selected for the color palette.

![colorpalette](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/love-running2/assets/168423322/f285851b-21d2-46e1-8d2d-6f232645311e)

To increase vibrancy across other areas of the page, gradient was used on some images and containers.

![gradient](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/love-running2/assets/168423322/1b0edbb2-81c5-4634-87d7-ed729f733b40)

**Typography**

Initially, only 'Russo One' font was selected for the entire website, but later 'Roboto' replaced it in paragraphs, because the initial font was quite hard to read in smaller sizes.

![fonts](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/love-running2/assets/168423322/72243609-4b97-42ae-ad84-f53f031e2edb)

**Navigation Bar**

The desktop navigation bar uses a minimalistic transparent design with white letters and 'Russo One' font from Google Fonts. On the left side, it has the club's logo (which is also used as a link to the homepage) and on the right - social media links.

![navdesktop](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/c23ea56f-9de0-4a88-bec3-484adf4c0bf4)

*On page load the entire navigation section drops down to it's assigned location.*

![navanimationdesktop](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/468b75b0-9cd4-4f66-80ce-ffaf9a110b28)

The mobile navigation bar uses an even more minimalistic design and only shows the club's logo while the actual menu is hidden until the dropdown menu is activated using the burger icon.

![mobilenav](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/a3aa8f81-6cf3-4d7f-8366-52333e01d423)

*Dropdown activation and transitions*

![mobilenavbar](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/19f4c23f-8810-428d-8d6a-19d748ec1534)

**Hero Section**

The hero section uses a picture of a car in full viewport height with a transparent gradient on top. The middle of the hero section has a welcome message to greet users.

*Desktop version*

![headerdesktop](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/807cde11-e1b8-4073-b6b0-9fa95f586cf0)

*Mobile Version*

![headermobile](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/ec3db39d-924b-4fc6-9c7d-b8a6a74c072c)

At the bottom of the hero section, there is a bouncing arrow suggesting to scroll down. It can also be clicked to be immediately taken down to the next section.

*Bouncing Arrow*

![arrowbounce](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/f684f17b-46b1-4cd0-bf4f-b9656f9efad5)

**Events Section**

The events section displays key information for club members - event title, location, time, and date. Every event is displayed with a picture that matches the event idea and a gradient overlay to increase readability.

![eventsresponsive](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/b41417db-c3f0-4c88-b386-6dd45302d75f)

**About Us Section**

The about us section provides information about the club, it's managing team, reasons to join and a video of the last club meet-up.

The design of this section is kept consistent across the entire website. Using two fonts, 'Russo One' for headings and 'Roboto' for paragraphs. There are horizontal rulers after every heading to show clear separation between different areas of the about section.

![about](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/0c3a0600-a821-414e-ad3e-ffa273f78b3b)

**Join Us Form**

The form provides users the ability to become members by filling in their details. The form uses validation and does not allow submission if the first or the last name fields are empty, also checks if there is an "@" symbol in the email address. The updates and the suggestions fields are optional. The form has been tested by using "formdump.codeinstitute.net" address and functions perfectly.

The design of the form is consistent with the simplistic theme of the website with the same gradient overlay as the hero section and white text.

![joinus](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/assets/168423322/228954bf-ff59-4c79-83a8-b82eee3a5ce7)

**Contact Section**

Lastly, the contact section informs of the club's address and provides a clickable telephone number and email address. Once clicked or pressed on the telephone number, most operating systems will open the default application for making calls and input the telephone number automatically. The same applies to the email address. 

To save time from copying and pasting the address, a Google Maps iframe is provided with the location.

## Bugs

During the development phase I encountered a few bugs, most of them were because of duplications or grammatical mistakes. They were rectified and commited to github for version control.

To see bug fixes on my GitHub repository follow [this](https://github.com/1nsomn1aa/Coding-Cars-and-Coffee/commits/main/) link.

To my knowledge, there are currently no bugs on the website.
